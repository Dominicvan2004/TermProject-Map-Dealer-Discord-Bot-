This was a OSU! discord bot project for my cpsc 101 class and now has turned into a side/passion project that I work on in my free time.

OSU! is a aim focused rythm game. The game has a extesnive collection of unique comunity made song charts known as beatmaps. The library of beatmaps ranges in the millions and being able to explore this massive library seems very interesting to me.  

My goals for this bot is to have it fetch a randomized OSU! map from their database using the python wrapper for the OSU! API made by <a href = "https://github.com/sheppsu/osu.py">Sheppsu</a> and return to the user via a url link.


I used this youtube <a href = "https://youtu.be/UYJDKSah-Ww?si=hVbC7yMIciR1Ticu">video</a> for the foundation of the bot and I'm building the program to pull a random map myself.
