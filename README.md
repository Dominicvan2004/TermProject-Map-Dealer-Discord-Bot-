Currently this is a OSU! discord bot project for my cpsc 101 class.

OSU! is a aim focused rythm game simialr similar to guitar hero. The game has a extesnive collection of unique comunity made song charts known as beatmaps. The library of beatmaps ranges in the millions and being able to explore this massive library seems very interesting to me.  

My goals for this bot is to have it fetch a randomized OSU! map from their database using the OSU!api and return to the user via a url link.


I used this youtube video https://youtu.be/UYJDKSah-Ww?si=hVbC7yMIciR1Ticu for the foundation of the bot and I'm building the program to pull a random map myself.


TO DO:

Probably find a different way to find a random map as this method is super slow and lazy. Also add slash commands.
