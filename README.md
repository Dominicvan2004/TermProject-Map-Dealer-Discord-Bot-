Currently this is a discord bot project for my cpsc 101 class.


My goals for this bot is to have it fetch a randomized OSU!
map from their database using the OSU!api and return to the user via a url link. 


I used this youtube [video https://youtu.be/UYJDKSah-Ww?si=hVbC7yMIciR1Ticu] 
for the foundation of the bot and I'm building the program to pull a random map myself.
